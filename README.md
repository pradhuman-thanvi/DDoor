# 🚪 DDoor – A Story of Hyperlocal Innovation

**DDoor** isn’t just a project — it’s a story.

Born in India in 2022, DDoor started as a vision to simplify everyday local tasks — deliveries, bookings, and dining — and bring them all under one digital roof. From small towns to big cities, DDoor aims to bridge the gap between users and the services around them.

We set out to build a platform that's fast, local, and made for everyone — a one-stop solution for your hyperlocal needs.
